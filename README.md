Windows console application for file text encoding conversion

## History
I thought it would be a simple task to change the encoding of a text file via a batch file in the Windows console and at the same time remove or add the BOM. But I found that even after extensive searching, I couldn't find a reasonable solution.

So I fired up my trusty Delphi and wrote a little console application myself that does exactly what I want.

I'm sure it will be a useful tool for someone else too and so I'm releasing it here as an open source project.
